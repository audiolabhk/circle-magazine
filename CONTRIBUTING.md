# Contributing

:smile: Thank you for contributing to Simply!

## Development

Simply uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage front-end packages.

```bash
# clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/godofredoninja/simply.git

# Go to the folder
$ cd simply

# link to ghost themes dir
$ ln -s $PWD path/to/ghost/content/themes/simply

# install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# run build & livereload task
$ yarn dev

# restart ghost server
$ cd path/to/ghost && ghost restart --development
```

### Icons

[Ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons) and generated by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) after import  `src/svg-icons/selection.json`

### Build commands

- `yarn dev` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start [livereload](http://livereload.com/)
- `yarn build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
- `yarn prod` — Compile assets for production and generate a `dist/simply.zip`

### Additional commands

- `yarn lint:js` — [Standard](https://standardjs.com/), Check for errors in the script.
- `yarn lint:css` — [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), Check for errors in the styles.
- `yarn lint` — Check error in script and styles.
- `yarn scan` — [Ghost Scan](https://github.com/TryGhost/gscan) check for errors, deprecation and other compatibility issues.
- `yarn test` — Check the script errors and styles then check the theme if it is compatible with the latest version of Ghost.

## Git/GitHub workflow

This is our preferred process for opening a PR on GitHub:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

    ```bash
    # Clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/simply.git

    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd simply

    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/godofredoninja/simply.git
    ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull upstream master
    ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

4. Locally merge:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git merge <topic-branch-name>
    ```

5. When your changes are ready for review, push your branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

7. When the changes have been reviewed and approved, I will merge for you.
